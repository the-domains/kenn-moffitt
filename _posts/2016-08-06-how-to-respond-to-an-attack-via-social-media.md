  Happy Friday, friends! A huge thanks to everyone who reached out about writing
  for this blog. If even a quarter of the people who expressed interest end up
  writing articles, you all will be in for a real treat. And will finally be
  able to read a post from some people who actually know what they're talking
  about.
