  If you're involved with SEO, you know that Google (and the other search
  engines) uses a complex algorithm to determine how a page ranks in the search
  engine results pages (SERPs). No one but Google knows exactly what's in the
  algorithm's "secret sauce" (it's rumored that there are more than 200 factors
  it considers), but SEO experts have inklings about what makes a page rank
  higher than others.
