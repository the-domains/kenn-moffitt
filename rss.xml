            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The three core values of successful marketing teams</h1><p>I recently read that the average tenure of a Chief Marketing Officer is 24 months, up from 18 months not very long ago.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is Google RankBrain and How Does It Affect Your Website's SERP Rankings?</h1><p>If you're involved with SEO, you know that Google (and the other search engines) uses a complex algorithm to determine how a page ranks in the search engine results pages (SERPs). No one but Google knows exactly what's in the algorithm's "secret sauce" (it's rumored that there are more than 200 factors it considers), but SEO experts have inklings about what makes a page rank higher than others.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e0632d1fd4a8c7e0a9c0a952f6f47e07/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=860&cropwidth=1680&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fd30cz2g5jd7t8z.cloudfront.net%2Fuploads%2Fmedia%2Fe4%2Fa2%2Fe4a20641012919f62807d2ae747a1292.jpg&x=0&y=51"></article>]]></description>
